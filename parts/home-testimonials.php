					<p class="text-green">"I have been a client of Records-Gebhart for almost 25 years now. They have always taken care of me in all aspects of insurance coverage in both car and property. I have had a couple of claims and they have handled them in a very professional manner with no complaints. My son has been insured with them for 16 years now and he is very satisfied as well. I have to put out a special compliment to Karol Gebhart, who has taken care of my account all these years always looking to save me money for the very best coverage that I can get. I would recommend them to anyone looking for great coverage at the best prices."</p>

					<p class="text-green">"Kyle and his team have always provided a level of service that goes above a simple "Insurance Agency." For the past 10 years, Records Gebhart has taken care of my business, flawlessly. There have been times where I thought that the business would not be covered, or that coverages needed to be adjusted. Again, never an issue. They have gone above and beyond to make sure that Turn of the Wrench, LLC is not only covered, but that all policies were priced accordingly as the business grew."</p>
